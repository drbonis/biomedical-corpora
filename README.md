|MMIMIC-CXR| https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/ | Yes | Yes | No | The MIMIC Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) Database v2.0.0 is a large publicly available dataset of chest radiographs in DICOM format with free-text radiology reports. The dataset contains 377,110 images corresponding to 227,835 radiographic studies performed at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA. |
| ChestX-ray | https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC/folder/36938765345 | Yes | Yes | Yes | ChestX-ray dataset comprises 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images of 30,805 unique patients with the text-mined fourteen disease image labels (where each image can have multi-labels), mined from the associated radiological reports using natural language processing.|
| COVID-19 Detection | https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/darshan1504/covid19-detection-xray-dataset | Yes | No | Yes | This dataset consists of X-ray(PA-CXR) images of COVID-19,bacterial and viral pneumonia patients and Normal people.|
| CoronaHack Chest Xray | https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/coronahack-chest-xraydataset | Yes | No | Yes | Collection Chest X Ray of Healthy vs Pneumonia (Corona) affected patients infected patients along with few other categories such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ) ,Streptococcus & ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) |
| CANDID-PTX | https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/CANDID-PTX/14173982 | Yes | Yes | Yes | 19,237 anonymized adult chest x-ray datasets in 1024 x 1024 pixel DICOM format with corresponding anonymized free-text reports from Dunedin Hospital, New Zealand between 2010 - 2020. Images were manually annotated by RANZCR radiology trainee and radiologists with respect to pneumothorax, acute rib fracture, and chest tubes. Segmentation annotations were converted to run-length-coded (RLE) format in csv files. In the provided metadata, image filenames contain patient index (enabling analysis requiring patient grouping of images), as well as anonymized date of acquisition information where the temporal relationship between images is preserved. |
| CheXpert Plus | https://aimi.stanford.edu/datasets/chexpert-plus | Yes | Yes | Yes | The CheXpert Plus dataset is a comprehensive collection that brings together text and images in the medical field, featuring a total of 223,462 unique pairs of radiology reports and chest X-rays across 187,711 studies from 64,725 patients. |
| CheXpert | https://aimi.stanford.edu/datasets/chexpert-chest-x-rays | Yes | Yes | Yes | CheXpert is a dataset consisting of 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients who underwent a radiographic examination at Stanford Health Care between October 2002 and July 2017,  in both inpatient and outpatient centers.  Included are their associated radiology reports. |
